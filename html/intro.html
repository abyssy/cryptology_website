		<h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
		<p><span >Cryptography</span> is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, and communication science. Applications of cryptography include military communications, electronic commerce, ATM cards, and computer passwords.</p>
		<h2>The Development</h2>
		<p>Along with the increasingly sharp and complex network space competition and confrontation，security issues have extended to the traditional area at an unprecedented depth and breath． With the emerging of new types of network forms and services such as the mobile Internet，the Internet of next generation，the Internet of things，the cloud computing，the named data networks and the big data，security requirements have transformed from a single user to multiple users on at least one of both communication ends．In this paper，the main characteristics of modern cryptography in multiparty scenarios are summarized．
		One is the change of end-to-end multiparty pattern，which changes from the one-to-one situation to the one-to-many，many-to-one and many-to-many situations，where the multiple users are dynamically defined by the access structure．The another is the change of multiple location pattern，where both the computing and processing are executed from the locality to the remote sides，including outsourced computation，outsourced signal processing and outsourced aggregation．</p>
		<h2>Cryptography in the new era</h2>
		<p><span>Quantum computers</span> may become a technological reality; it is therefore important to study cryptographic schemes used against adversaries with access to a quantum computer. The study of such schemes is often referred to as post-<span>quantum cryptography</span>. The need for post-quantum cryptography arises from the fact that many popular encryption and signature schemes (such as RSA and its variants, and schemes based on elliptic curves) can be broken using Shor's algorithm for factoring and computing discrete logarithms on a quantum computer. Examples for schemes that are, as of today's knowledge, secure against quantum adversaries are McEliece and lattice-based schemes. Surveys of post-quantum cryptography are available.
		There is also research into how existing cryptographic techniques have to be modified to be able to cope with quantum adversaries. For example, when trying to develop zero-knowledge proof systems that are secure against quantum adversaries, new techniques need to be used: In a classical setting, the analysis of a zero-knowledge proof system usually involves "rewinding", a technique that makes it necessary to copy the internal state of the adversary. In a quantum setting, copying a state is not always possible (no-cloning theorem); a variant of the rewinding technique has to be used.
		Post quantum algorithms are also called "quantum resistant", because – unlike QKD – it is not known or provable that there will not be potential future quantum attacks against them. Even though they are not vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, the NSA is announcing plans to transition to quantum resistant algorithms.</p>
